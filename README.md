This is a blog package that was developed under Udemy's "100 Days of Python" course (Day 71). 
It contains additional image files, both course-supplied and other, that I used and may use again. 
Also included is the course-supplied database file and my own that is in use. 
Much of the code is course-supplied with my additions as directed by the instruction. 
Comments always welcome.
